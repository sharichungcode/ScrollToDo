[Deployed Website](https://scroll-to-do-fc37dc092ebb.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience
### Purpose
- ScrollToDo is a task management tool designed for users to efficiently create, organize, and prioritize their tasks in an engaging way.
- It introduces an intuitive prioritization system that mimics the casual scrolling experience of social media, making task management more interactive and effortless.
- The target audience includes professionals, students, and anyone seeking an innovative way to manage tasks with a focus on prioritization.

## Agile Methodology
- Agile methodology was used to guide development, ensuring flexibility and iterative improvements.
- A project board was set up to track user stories, each assigned a 'MoSCoW' prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
- The project board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/sharichungcode/projects/3/).

### User Stories
1. **As a user, I can create tasks so that I can manage my to-do list efficiently.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - A simple input field allows task creation.
    - Tasks appear immediately in the list upon creation.

2. **As a user, I can prioritize tasks using a ranking system so that I can focus on whatâ€™s most important.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Tasks can be ranked using drag-and-drop.
    - A matrix-based prioritization option allows sorting tasks into quadrants.

3. **As a user, I can prioritize tasks in a priority matrix format easily so that I can visually organize tasks by urgency and importance.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Tasks can be dragged and dropped into a 2x2 priority matrix.
    - The matrix clearly distinguishes between urgent/important, urgent/not important, not urgent/important, and not urgent/not important tasks.

4. **As a user, I can track my progress so that I can monitor completed tasks.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - A checkbox allows users to mark tasks as completed.
    - Completed tasks are visually distinguished from active tasks.

5. **As a user, I can edit and delete tasks so that I can adjust my list as needed.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Tasks can be edited in place.
    - Tasks can be removed from the list.

6. **As a user, I can view my tasks across devices so that I can access them anywhere.**
  - SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - The app is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    - Cloud-based storage ensures task persistence across sessions.
